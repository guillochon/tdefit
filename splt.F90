      subroutine splt (x, y, yp, nxy, t_o, nt, tsorted,  &
                       sigma, spl_o)

! (out)LINE:
! "Tense" cubic spline interpolator, adapted from IDL.  
! Normally set sigma to 1.0.
! Converted to Fortran by Marshall McCall, 99 June, using as
! a reference the original Fortran source code from FITPACK
! from which the IDL routine was derived.
! Note subtle differences between FITPACK and IDL code, particularly
! in setting initial approximation for endpoint slopes for nxy=2.
! Also, the routine does not allow sigma to be zero (formulae
! in that extreme were omitted).
! Adjustments were made to check if input arrays are sorted.

! Extrapolations are not allowed.  If it is required, the
! result is set to the value of the nearest endpoint.

! Checked by reproducing reddening curve of Fitzpatrick.

! INPUTS:
!	x:    The abcissa vector, sorted into ascending order.
!	y:    The vector of ordinate values corresponding to x.
!	yp:   The vector of second derivatives at each x.
!       nxy:    The number of elements in x, y, and yp.
!	t_o:    The vector of abcissae values for which the ordinate is 
!		desired. 
!       nt:     The number of elements of t_o.
!       tsorted:  A Boolean describing whether or not t has been
!                 sorted into a monotonicallly ascending order.
!	sigma:  The amount of "tension" that is applied to the curve. 
!               The default value is 1.0. If sigma is close to 0, 
!               (e.g., .01), then effectively there is a cubic spline 
!               fit. If sigma is large, (e.g., greater than 10), then 
!               the fit will be like a polynomial interpolation.
 
! (out)PUTS:
!	spline returns a vector of interpolated ordinates.
!	spl_o(i) = value of the function at t_o(i).
 
! RESTRICTIONS:
!       Must run splt_p first to get x, y, and yp from x_o and y_o.
